# PttChrome as Clam-Test BBS Websocket Client

[![build and deploy status](https://github.com/clamtestbbs/PttChrome/actions/workflows/deploy-ghpage.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/clamtestbbs/PttChrome/actions/workflows/deploy-ghpage.yml)

A Telnet-over-WebSocket client, forked from [robertabcd/PttChrome](https://github.com/robertabcd/PttChrome).

To quickly grasp the idea of how to customize the behavior, see [.github/workflows/deploy-ghpage.yml](https://github.com/ccns/PttChrome/blob/dev-update/.github/workflows/deploy-ghpage.yml).

This workflow sets up the configuration before building PttChrome. The client built with this configuration connects to DreamBBS ([ccns.cc](https://term.ccns.cc)) by default and uses the icon set provided by CCNS.

Without such configuration, the built client will instead connect to Ptt ([ptt.cc](https://term.ptt.cc)) and use the icon set from the original PttChrome as the original version does.
